#Weather application

## A simple Angular 4 app, showing weather forecast in the cities


"Weather App" is a simple weather forecast app, created in Angular 4. It displayes a list of predefined cities with main forecast information. By clicking on
the city name, a page with extended forecast data is displayed. 

The forecast data is provided from Wunderground apis. 

The app is responsive.

Main features why I created this app:

- Angular 4
- Routing
- Components
- Search
- Get data from an API
- protractor config
- jasmine
- e2e testing
